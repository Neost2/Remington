# CarePath

## About

CarePath is a transportation coordination tool that helps patients arrange reliable rides to medical appointments, aiming to reduce no-shows and improve access to essential healthcare.

CarePath is designed to be location-agnostic and does not rely on mileage as a decision factor.

The project is focused on removing transportation and communication failures that cause missed care. It is being shaped through early validation conversations with patients, caregivers, and transportation stakeholders.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org)

The setup script will:

1. Check Node.js and npm versions
2. Create `.env` from `.env.example`
3. Prompt for your `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and optional Twilio credentials
4. Install API and UI dependencies
5. Generate the Prisma client and run database migrations
6. Print startup instructions

### Starting the app

```bash
# Start both API and UI together
npm run dev:all

# Or start separately
npm run dev                        # API → http://localhost:3001
cd carepath-ui && npm run dev      # UI  → http://localhost:3000
